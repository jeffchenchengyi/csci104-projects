Problem 1c (Break QuickSort, 5%)
Give an array of size 10 of doubles, where the pivot will always 
be the 2nd largest or 2nd smallest element of the array (when using 
the median-of-3 pivot). Explain your answer.




Problem 2 (Break Interpolation Search, 10%)
Recall the Interpolation Search algorithm from class. We said in class 
that it could take linear time in the worst case. 
Describe an array of size n of double, such that Interpolation Search will 
query each entry of the array before finally finding its target. 
Explain your answer.




Problem 3 (Median Finding in Linear Time, 30%)
In class, we had talked about the fact that Quicksort works best when 
it can use the median of the input array as a pivot in each round. 
We asserted that there is an algorithm with linear time that finds the median. 
Here, we will give you that algorithm, and you will analyze it. 
In fact, the algorithm is more general than finding the median: you give it 
an array a of items of type T (which can be compared), as well as a position k, 
and it will return in time O(n) the kth smallest element of a. 
(Ties are broken arbitrarily.) The algorithm is the following.

T quantile (T* a, int left, int right, int k)
{ /* a is the array to look in.
     left and right are the bounds of the subarray we search in.
     k is the index (starting at 0, with a left end of left) 
     of the element we would like, in the sorted version of the array. 
     If that sounds confusing, think about it as follows:
     We could sort a between left and right, and return a[k+left]
     after sorting. But that would take too long. */

  if (right <= left + 10) // we are down to a small array
  {  // sorting and looking up after sorting is fast enough.
    InsertionSort (a, left, right);  // Sorts a between left and right.
    return a[k+left];
  }
    else   // we still have a pretty big array left
  {
    int smallsize = (right-left)/5;
    T *b = new T[smallsize];

    /* The next loop considers the array in groups of 5.
       For each such group, the median (which is element 2) is copied
       into the new array b. 
       If the number of elements is not divisible by 5, then the last
       few elements are not considered here. */
    for (int i = 0; i < smallsize; i ++)
       b[i] = quantile (a, left+5*i, left+5*(i+1)-1, 2);

    /* The next line is key: it finds the median of the elements of b,
       i.e., the median of the medians of groups-of-5. */
    T pivot = quantile (b, 0, smallsize-1, smallsize/2);

    /* Now, we need to find the pivot in a, so we can swap it into
       the rightmost position. We use linear search, since a is not sorted. */
    int p = linearSearch (a, left, right, pivot);
    a.swap (p, right);

    // The partition function here is exactly our old friend from Quicksort.
    int m = partition (a, left, right);

    /* Finally, we can compare the position of the pivot to the position we
       are looking for. 
       If they are equal, the pivot was what we wanted.
       If we are looking for an earlier position, 
       we need to search in the left subarray.
       If we are looking for a later position, 
       we need to search in the right subarray.
       But we also need to subtract the pivot's position, 
       since position 5 in an array of size 8
       is equal to position 1 in the right half of the array. */
    if (left+k == m) return a[m];
    else if (left+k < m) return quantile (a, left, m-1, k);
    else return quantile (a, m+1, right, k-(m+1-left));
}
First go through this algorithm and understand it as best you can. 
You do not need to understand why it works to solve this problem, 
so focus on what it does. Simulating it by hand a bit, or coding 
it up if you like, may also help you.

We will walk you through the analysis with several smaller questions. 
You are welcome to try a different route, but our suggestions are 
meant to help keep you from going off on a wrong path. 
The quantity n here should be right-left.


Part a (Set up a Recurrence Relation, 20%)
1. Analyze the running time of all the parts of the function other than 
the recursive calls. You may use everything you know about the 
running time of linear search, the partition function, and Insertion Sort.

2. In the loop that assigns values to each b[i], how big is the input size 
for each recursive call? 
Thus, how long do the recursive calls to quantile() take? 
How many such recursive calls are made? How far can you simplify the 
total time for all of this?

3. In the recursive call that assigns a value to pivot, how big is the array? 
Thus, how long does the recursive call take?

4. Explain why at least 3n/10 elements in a are <= the pivot, and at 
least 3n/10 elements are >= the pivot. Which are those elements? 
(You can ignore constant terms, i.e., if it's really 3n/10-4 elements 
which are smaller/larger, feel free to discard the -4 term.)

5. As a result of your analysis, how big at most is the array for the 
recursive call that is made in the last or second-to-last line?

6. Putting everything together, show that the recurrence relation for 
the running time of the quantile() function is T(n) = T(n/5)+T(7n/10)+Î˜(n) n >= 10. 
Also specify the base case for your recurrence relation.


Part b (Solve the Recurrence, 10%)
Next, we need to solve the recurrence, by drawing the recursive call 
tree (as we did with Mergesort in class).

1. Each node/block in your tree should correspond to a specific recursive call 
to quantile(). This call has a corresponding array on which the function is 
supposed to run. 
Label each node in your tree with the size of the array.

2. For each node, specify the run time attributed to this specific recursive call. 
This should include any sub-calls which do not get their own node in the tree. 
It should not include run time attributed to other nodes in the tree.

3. Draw edges between the nodes, indicating the important recursive calls 
which are made. 
Make sure to indicate the size of the array for each node. 
Do this for a few layers.

4. How much total work is done in the nodes in the ith layer, for each i?

5. How many layers are there?

6. Now add up the work across all the layers, using your knowledge of summations.

If all went well, you should have arrived at an answer of O(n). 
If not, you may want to go back and see where you went wrong along the way.
